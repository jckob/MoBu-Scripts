Using the Story Mode, script inserts the take, creates a copy in different Track and rotates it.
Then by turning it on and off, the animation is plotted onto a properly named new track. 

If the tool fails to work correctly:
 - check if you are using the 2024 MoBu
 - check if your MoBu can execute Python code
    Open Python Editor in MoBu, in the console type "print("just kidding")" and click ENTER. After executing the code, you should see the text.
 - Bake your character to Control Rig

 Be aware that this tool is not very popular. I recomend using it on a new scene!
