Diving Take Tool
Easy way to seperate your take into smaller takes.


If the tool fails to work correctly:
 - check if you are using the 2024 MoBu
 - check if your MoBu can execute Python code
    Open Python Editor in MoBu, in the console type "print("just kidding")" and click ENTER. After executing the code, you should see the text.
 - Switch your time format from timecode to frames.

 Be aware that this tool is not very popular, so it wasn't tested in many cases. There may be some bugs :/
